# Website

My website written in NodeJs/Express (i'm very proud for information). Can login/logout locally (with an email and a password), with google, discord and github. Supports link and unlink accounts to your "profile" using MongoDB.
There's also an admin panel that I'm going to add a lot of things to. I just want to centralize everything in one place.
