# Website

My website written in NodeJs/Express (i'm very proud for information). Can login/logout locally (with an email and a password), with google, discord and github. Supports link and unlink accounts to your "profile" using MongoDB.
There's also an admin panel that I'm going to add a lot of things to. I just want to centralize everything in one place.


Update :

Too lazy to update because Mongo doesn't support callback anymore so it's Promise EVERYWHERE...
What do I plan to do in the future ? Working on the admin panel to put a lot of things.

# 2024 UPDATE
Same for [this repo](https://github.com/SounaVR/HomeWebsite) I'll archive it and work on a React/Express Personal Website and put Server/Client in the same repo (like [this one](https://github.com/SounaVR/RatMessenger))
